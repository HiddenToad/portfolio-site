<h1>About This Site</h1>

    <h2>Why'd you make this site?</h1>
    <p>This website serves as an online portfolio of my work. Unlike my Github, it highlights some projects I'm proud of, rather than just anything I've deemed worth saving, and it 
        gives me a space to explain them in a way that's (hopefully) engaging and makes the work accessible to understand to non-programmers.
    </p>

    <h2>How should I use this site?</h2>
    <p>Well, that's up to you! I've tried to be concise and effective in what I've created here. Hopefully, anyone viewing this would be able to look at everything I've added to
        this site without too much of a time investment. I am proud of everything on here, and would love if someone read the entire site. 
        However, if you're short on time, I would suggest you look at the <a href="/">About Me section</a> for background on who I am and what I love about programming,
         the <a href="/raytracer">Raytracer article</a>, as I consider it to be my most technically impressive project, and my <a href="/connect4">Connect 4 Bot video</a>,
        because you get to see some of my personality and hear my thought process.
    </p>

    <h2>I noticed there's a lot of external links- should I look at all of them?</h2>
    <p>Yeah, there's a lot, especially on that About Me page. Generally, I insert a hyperlink for 1 of 3 reasons. The first is that a concept might be too in depth to fully explain in the article, and I 
        want to give a curious reader the option of learning more. The second is to allow a reader to look at the specifics of something I'm talking about: if I mention a programming language,
        I might link to its webpage to allow someone to see what it's about. The third is to add a dumb joke. I think if you clicked on every link in this site and explored it in depth, you'd triple
        the time it took to view the whole site. So, I'd say click on something if you're curious about it. Maybe you'll find <a href="./dumbjoke" target="_blank">a dumb joke</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>I have a computer science background-- what did you use to make this site?</h2>
    <p>
        The server was made in Rust with <a href="https://actix.rs/" target="_blank">Actix Web</a>. Aside from simply serving the HTML, it runs the model and communicates with the client for the
        <a href="./linear" target="_blank">Linear Regression</a> interactive page. The frontend is literally just bare HTML/CSS/JS because I <cite>hate</cite> frontend and as a result never learned any libraries.
        It looks fine, and should theoretically work on different sized screens. Spent wayyyy too long making that shadow gradient in the background look right, though. Still, worth it.
