        <p>Hi! My name is Juju and I've always loved solving puzzles. When I was in 5th grade, my middle school had a computer class. We mostly did visual block coding puzzles like <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://code.org">Hour of Code</a>. I quickly got
            the hang of it, and started creating little Scratch projects based on my favorite games. My teacher realized that I had grasped the basics and started me off on an Intro to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> course. After that class, I didn't touch
            a command line for a few years, until the pandemic boredom pushed me to pursue this interest again. </p>
            
            <p>I quickly fell in love again, starting out with little <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripts (a <a target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/353">remarkably simple</a> language to get the hang of). The scripts mostly solved mathematical puzzles I was interested in,
            like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">the Monty Hall problem</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">the Secretary Problem</a>. Soon, I realized that I wanted to understand  how computers worked at a deeper level,
             and began teaching myself a more bare metal language: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++.</a> I was 
            enamored with its speed and the way that every line of code I wrote was precisely manipulating memory and data down to the bytes. I began challenging myself to create high level projects using only C++ and no external code libraries,
            such as a simple <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chaining</a> application to find patterns in data, and a simple multithreaded webserver. I read <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Meyers">Scott Meyers' <cite>Effective C++</cite> book series</a>, which taught me to think deeper
             about how my code was working
            at a very precise, structural level, and greatly aided my mastery of the language and programming in general. In school, I would pay just enough attention to my classes to pass, but every second of my free time was spent on personal coding
            projects or doing <a target="_blank" href="https://codewars.com">programming challenges</a> online to keep my skills up.
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout this time, I learned a few other languages for other projects (to different degrees of mastery). I learned simple Javascript with HTML and CSS for site-building (which I dislike but tolerate, mostly due to my tendency towards aesthetic perfectionism
            in things I create, and <a target="_blank" href="./dumbjoke" target="_blank">excessive hyperlinks</a>). I learned <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin">Xamarin</a> app development,
                rudimentary <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a> for simple productivity scripts, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> for database management. C++ remained my favorite for a while because of its speed the level of control it gave the programmer. Then, in 2021, I decided to check out a language that people were
                talking about online and touting its virtues. Enter <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" style="text-shadow: 0 0 1em rgb(255, 231, 93)">Rust</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rust is an attempt to create a low level language with the speed and control of C++ that integrates directly into the language a lot of the unintuitive "best practices" that C++ programmers have to memorize and follow. It was easy to get into
                (the website has <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">an entire book</a> on it teaching you the language) and easy to get started on (the Rust package manager makes installation a breeze).
                 The coolest thing is that Rust's compiler uses <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">some neat semantic rules</a> to catch many types of unsafe code before the program even runs, turning inscrutable bugs 
                 into simple changes to the structure of your code. Since learning Rust, I have adopted it as my language
                of choice, and I use it for pretty much anything where it is practical. In fact, the server for this website is written in Rust. For more on that, check out <a href="./aboutsite">About This Site</a>. I might use other languages if it's most practical, 
                such as for a quick script that is not performance intensive (I would use Python) or for webcode that directly interacts with HTML (I would use
                Javascript).
            </p>
            <p>
                From the things I said about school, and about my experience with programming, you might be able to tell that I am a person of highly directed passion. When something interests me, <a href="https://xkcd.com/356" target="_blank">I want to pursue it to the utmost depth.</a>
                 However,
                often in school I struggled with being forced to sit through classes on things I was less than passionate about. My hope going into college education is that I will be able to explore primarily my computer science interests, while also leaving
                room for any other academic or artistic interests I wish to explore during that time. I want to use it as an opportunity to dive deeper into programming, but also wider into other fields and ideas. I find so many things fascinating, and I always
                look forward to exploring more.
