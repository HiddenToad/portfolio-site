    <h1>Connect 4 Bot - Video Demo</h1>
    <div class="articletext">
        <h2>Why is this a video?</h2>
        <p>Well, originally it was going to be an interactive project. <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>, the lovely open source game engine I used for this project, has support for web. 
        Unfortunately, I created this project using <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext" target="_blank">gdext</a>, a language extension library that allows you to use Rust code for Godot projects. While this 
        extension library works fine for desktop builds, it's unstable for <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>, which is required for running a compiled game on the web. </p>
        <p>I was going to give up and use a different project for this site, but I was pretty happy with this one. So, I decided to do a video. Although this page itself is not interactive as I had planned, you still
            do get to watch the project in action, hopefully accomplishing something similar to a true interactive page.
        </p>
        <p>The video ended up longer than I expected, but I edited it together with some relevant visuals and some silliness from Editor Juju in subtitles to hopefully make it a bit more engaging.
            If 15 minutes is just too long for you, I recommend at least watching until the explanation of the flowchart. That's the part I feel is most important to see. Anyways, here's the video!
